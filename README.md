# Testing using Ruby and Cucumber

These are some very basic examples on how TDD and BDD work in Ruby.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

### General principles

1. Write the smallest possible test case (unit test) for one unit in the code.
1. Run the test and watch it failing.
1. Write the actual code for this unit.
1. Run the test again.
1. Repeat this as long as the test passes and refactor the code in the process.

### Executing the test

* Go inside the `tdd` folder
* Execute the test with

```bash
ruby tests/hello_test.rb
```

* Watch the test failing
* Open `hello.rb` and enable the code
* Run the test again

## Behavior-driven development (BDD)
